# Embarrassingly-simple-ZSL
This repository contains the code for the real data experiments appearing in our paper <a href="http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/romera-paredes15.pdf">An embarrassingly simple approach to zero-shot learning</a>, presented at ICML 2015.

Before running the experiments you have to download the datasets from <a href="http://pub.ist.ac.at/~chl/ABC/">http://pub.ist.ac.at/~chl/ABC/</a>.
Then you uncompress each dataset in any directory you want, and then you put that directory in datasetPath.
Move to any of the directories, corresponding to each of the real dataset, and run runExperiment.m
