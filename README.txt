First you have to download the datasets from the web appearing in the paper: http://pub.ist.ac.at/~chl/ABC/ .
Then you uncompress each dataset in any directory you want, and then you put that directory in datasetPath.
Move to any of the directories, corresponding to each of the real dataset, and run runExperiment.m
